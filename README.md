With the advance of wireless technologies and detection techniques, several studies have shown the effectiveness of wireless signals to identify human activities. This has enabled the development of diverse applications, such as intrusion detection or action recognition. 
The movements of the human body influence the propagation of the wireless signal, which creates new possibilities for capturing and analyzing these movements by processing the received signals.


This master’s thesis continues the project started in the author’s final degree project in 2023. Its objective was to explore various methods for detecting presence and motion by analyzing changes in radio frequency signals. 
The study focused specifically on signals at a frequency in the 868 MHz band. Following the promising results, this master’s thesis was conceived as a continuation of that work, with the new objective of implementing the whole study and the developed system on the Securitas Direct devices.


This project has been carried out at the Securitas Direct Verisure university chair at the Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicación of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, within a scholarship program focused on areas of interest for the company and that complements the training of the university students.
