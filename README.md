📘 Overview

With the advancement of wireless communication and sensing technologies, radio frequency (RF) signals have emerged as a powerful tool to detect human activity without the need for cameras or physical contact. Movements of the human body influence wireless signal propagation, enabling innovative applications in fields such as: Intrusion detection, human presence and motion recognition or ambient intelligence and smart environments. This master's thesis builds upon the author’s 2023 undergraduate research, enhancing and extending the initial work to real-world applications.
